# Glass UI adoption verification

September 21, 2026 · source implementation and engineering review only.

The project S04 validator passed fresh import, S04 behavior, full restart, S03 behavior, and S02 regression stages. Evidence: evidence/S04/run-20260921T161938Z. A fresh disposable-copy 1280×720 render was inspected; the header backing height was adjusted afterward and the render repeated. The frozen owner candidate remains unchanged.

## Retained review

The shared [review gallery](../../UI%20Templates/review.html) contains screenshots and browser check results. Browser specimens are local fixtures or isolated startup states. Web review checked representative 1440px/390px layouts, page exceptions, and page-level horizontal overflow; it is not an exhaustive audit of every state, contrast pair, screen reader, browser, installed build, or physical phone.

Template gallery search, form submit feedback, dialog opening, and Escape dismissal were exercised. Shared styles include keyboard focus, reduced-motion, and reduced-transparency handling. Native Godot is a basic translucent fallback, not a true blur material. Native games retain their desktop layout and illustrated artwork.

See [design and future template use](ui-design.md). No owner acceptance or release qualification is inferred. Rebuild/relaunch the appropriate source application to see the change; installed or frozen copies remain their original versions.
