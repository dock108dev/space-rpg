# Space Opera RPG UI design

Updated September 21, 2026. Shared Glass UI Starter 01; presentation-only adoption.

## For future contributors

Start with [local design requirements](ui-design-requirements.md), then review the shared [UI Templates gallery](../../UI%20Templates/index.html) and [template guide](../../UI%20Templates/README.md). The source folder on the owner's Mac is `/Users/michaelfuscoletti/Desktop/UI Templates`. It contains dashboard, list/table, form/setup, settings, detail, state/dialog, and native Godot starters.

Use light cool glass, slate text, blue actions, restrained depth, rounded controls, and system typography as the default. Do not reintroduce the generic beige/green/yellow template. Preserve explicit semantic success, caution, error, unavailable, and unknown states. Readability and the task's layout outrank decoration.

The shared folder is a design reference, not a runtime dependency. Project assets are checked in locally and can run without the Desktop folder. If you receive this repository alone, this local requirements copy and the implementation describe the baseline. Request the source template folder when you need the full gallery. Template revisions are adopted deliberately, never silently synchronized.

## This project's adaptation

Working S03/S04 controls use the native template; the HUD uses a cool dark glass adaptation for contrast over the illustrated world. Game art and mechanics remain unchanged. Frozen builds/S04-20260909-01 and Launch Owner Play.command remain the original candidate. Launch S04.command uses the changed working source; no frozen-candidate acceptance transfers. Native surfaces do not use a screen-reading blur shader.

Implementation: game/scripts/glass_ui.gd; game/scripts/tactical_encounter.gd.

## Review and status

See [UI adoption verification](ui-verification.md). Source changes and technical/visual checks do not establish owner acceptance, a new release, live-data qualification, or acceptance of an older frozen candidate. Existing project-specific gates remain separate.
